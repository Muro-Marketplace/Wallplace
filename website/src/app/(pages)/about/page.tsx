              Wallspace exists because thousands of incredible photographs sit
              in artists&rsquo; studios while thousands of bare walls in
              cafes could be transformed by them. We make the
              connection effortless.

              <h2 className="text-3xl mb-5">The Problem We Saw</h2>
              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Walk into most independent cafes, restaurants, or coworking
                spaces and you will see one of two things: bare walls,
                or mass-produced prints that could be in any city in the world.
                Meanwhile, there are some of the most talented emerging
                photographers and artists anywhere &mdash; people creating
                extraordinary work that deserves to be seen.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                The problem is not a lack of supply or demand. It is the gap
                between them. Artists do not know which venues want art. Venues
                do not know where to find artists. And even when they do connect,
                the logistics of selecting, pricing, delivering, and managing
                artwork can be overwhelming for both sides.

              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Wallspace is a curated art placement service. We review and
                accept artists based on the quality of their work. We match them
                with venues that suit their style. We handle the logistics of
                getting art on walls and managing the relationship over time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                For artists, we provide exhibition space, exposure, and sales
                opportunities without the cost or commitment of a traditional
                gallery. For venues, we provide a rotating selection of original,
                high-quality artwork that transforms their space and creates
                talking points for their customers &mdash; all with no upfront
                cost and minimal effort.

              Quality is everything. We are not a marketplace where anyone can
