                  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device
                  when you visit a website. They are widely used to make
                  websites work efficiently, remember your preferences, and
                  provide information to website owners. Cookies set by the
                  website owner (in this case, Wallspace) are called
                  &ldquo;first-party cookies&rdquo;. Cookies set by parties
                  other than the website owner are called &ldquo;third-party
                  cookies&rdquo; and may be set by our service providers.
