// cookies (never set by the app, the auth session lives in localStorage)
// and a wallplace_cookie_consent cookie (actually a localStorage key,
// wallplace-cookie-consent, with no expiry). It now describes the
// browser local storage the site really uses. Wallplace itself sets no
// cookies; keep this table in step with the code if that ever changes.
//
// UK compliance audit, 10 September 2026: the consent key became
// wallplace-storage-notice-dismissed, because it records a dismissal and
// never recorded a consent. The banner offered Accept and Decline over
// storage that is entirely strictly necessary, and nothing in the codebase
// read the answer. This page was already accurate about there being no
// cookies and no third-party tags; the banner is now accurate too.

                <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device
                  when you visit a website. They are widely used to make
                  websites work efficiently, remember your preferences, and
                  provide information to website owners. Cookies set by the
                  website owner (in this case, Wallplace) are called
                  &ldquo;first-party cookies&rdquo;. Cookies set by parties
                  other than the website owner are called &ldquo;third-party
                  cookies&rdquo; and may be set by our service providers.

                <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed mt-4">
                  Wallplace currently sets no cookies of its own. Instead we
                  use your browser&rsquo;s local storage, a similar mechanism
                  where small pieces of information are kept on your device by
                  your browser and are only readable by this site. This policy
                  covers both so you can see exactly what is stored.
