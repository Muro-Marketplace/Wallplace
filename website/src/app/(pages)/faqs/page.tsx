    "Frequently asked questions about Wallplace for artists, venues, and buyers.",
};

const generalFaqs = [
  {
    question: "What is Wallplace?",
    answer:
      "Wallplace is a curated marketplace connecting emerging and established artists with independent venues \u2014 cafes, restaurants, coworking spaces, offices, and more \u2014 that want original artwork on their walls. We handle the curation and provide the platform for discovery, communication, and sales. Artists manage their own fulfilment and delivery.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Wallplace make money?",
    answer:
      "Wallplace earns through artist membership plans (from £9.99/month) and a platform fee on artwork sales (3–15% depending on the artist's plan). When a piece sells, the artist keeps the majority. We do not charge venues for displaying artwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Wallplace a gallery?",
    answer:
      "Not in the traditional sense. We do not have a physical gallery space. Instead, we use the walls of independent venues as our exhibition spaces. This means artists get their work seen by thousands of people in everyday settings, and venues get beautiful original art without the cost of commissioning it directly.",
  },
];

const artistFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to join Wallplace as an artist?",
    answer:
      "It is free to apply. Once accepted, membership starts from £9.99/month (Core plan) with your first month free. Higher tiers (Premium at £24.99/month, Pro at £49.99/month) offer lower platform fees on sales and more visibility. See our pricing page for full details.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the curation process work?",
    answer:
      "After you submit your application with a portfolio of your work, our team reviews it based on technical quality, originality, consistency, and suitability for display in commercial spaces. We aim to respond within 5 business days. If accepted, we will schedule an onboarding call to discuss your portfolio, pricing, and preferences.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when my work sells?",
    answer:
      "When a piece sells, we process the transaction and notify you immediately. You receive payment within 14 days via Stripe Connect. The platform fee (3\u201315% depending on your plan) is deducted automatically \u2014 you keep the majority. You are responsible for packing and shipping the artwork to the buyer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set my own prices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You set the prices for your work. We may offer guidance on pricing based on our experience of what sells well in venue settings, but the final decision is always yours. We will never list your work at a price you have not agreed to.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to provide framed work?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. We work with artists to determine the best presentation for their work. Some pieces are displayed framed, others unframed. We can help arrange framing at competitive rates through our partners, or you can provide your own frames. Framing costs are discussed during onboarding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my work gets damaged in a venue?",
    answer:
      "Venues agree to exercise reasonable care over displayed artwork under our Venue Partnership Agreement. If damage occurs due to venue negligence, the venue is liable. We strongly recommend you insure your artwork for its full value, including periods when it is on display in venues. Wallplace can help facilitate communication between you and the venue, but we are not liable for damage, loss, or theft of artwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel my membership?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can cancel at any time with 30 days\u2019 notice. You are responsible for collecting your artwork from any venues where it is currently displayed within 30 days of your cancellation date. No cancellation fees or penalties apply.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Wallplace exclusive? Can I sell my work elsewhere?",
    answer:
      "Wallplace is non-exclusive. You are free to sell your work through other channels, galleries, your own website, or any other platform. We only ask that if a piece is currently on display in a venue through Wallplace, you let us know before selling it through another channel so we can arrange a replacement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my artwork protected from theft?",
    answer:
      "Every image on Wallplace is served at reduced resolution with compressed quality \u2014 good enough for browsing, not enough for reproduction. Right-click saving is disabled, and images cannot be dragged or selected. The original high-resolution file never leaves your hands \u2014 we only display a web-optimised version. Our Terms of Service prohibit unauthorised reproduction, and every sale is tracked and attributed to you as the creator.",
  },
];

const venueFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How much does it cost for a venue to display art?",
    answer:
      "Nothing. There is no cost to venues for browsing, enquiring, or displaying artwork through Wallplace. Delivery and installation are arranged directly between you and the artist. Wallplace is funded by artist memberships, not by charges to venues.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need to sign a contract?",
    answer:
      "Yes, we ask venues to sign a simple partnership agreement that covers the basics: care of artwork, display period, and what happens if a piece sells or is damaged. The agreement is straightforward, written in plain English, and can be cancelled with 30 days notice.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if a piece of art gets damaged?",
    answer:
      "Under the Venue Partnership Agreement, venues must exercise reasonable care over displayed artwork. If damage occurs due to negligence by venue staff or contractors, the venue is liable and should cooperate with the artist to resolve it. We recommend reporting any damage to both the artist and Wallplace within 48 hours. Wallplace can facilitate communication but is not liable for artwork damage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we choose which art to display?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You browse artist portfolios on the platform and enquire directly with artists whose work interests you. You have the final say on what goes on your walls. You can also arrange rotations directly with artists to keep things fresh.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when a customer wants to buy a piece?",
    answer:
      "Each artwork on display includes a discreet label with the artist name, title, and a QR code or URL linking to the piece on Wallplace. Customers can enquire or purchase directly through us. Your staff do not need to handle any sales – they just point customers to the label.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do our staff need to do anything?",
    answer:
      "Very little. Delivery and installation are arranged between you and the artist. Once artwork is up, your team just needs to keep an eye on it (as they would any decor) and point curious customers to the QR label for information and purchasing. No sales handling required.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often does the artwork change?",
    answer:
      "That depends on your arrangement with the artist. Some venues prefer a rotation every 2\u20133 months to keep the space feeling fresh. Others prefer to keep pieces longer. You agree this directly with the artist when arranging the placement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we buy the artwork ourselves?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can purchase any artwork at the listed price through the QR code or directly on the platform. Some artists also offer special pricing for venue purchases \u2014 discuss this with the artist directly.",
  },
