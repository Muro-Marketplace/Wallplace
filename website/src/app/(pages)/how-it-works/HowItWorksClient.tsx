          tabbed copy stays legible on top of the image. The negative
          top margin pulls the section under the fixed header so the
          image fills the full viewport. `isolate` keeps the -z-10
          image stack inside this section so the dark fallback bg sits
          underneath it (and shows immediately, even before the image
          finishes loading or if it fails entirely). */}

        {/* The hero is min-h-screen and grows when the selected
            audience's copy runs longer (artist and customer tabs both
            push past venue's). The image container used to be pinned
            to 100vh so the crop never changed between tabs, but that
            left a bare dark band under the copy on the taller tabs
            (owner-reported 2 September). The image now fills the
            whole section; object-cover re-crops slightly when a taller
            tab is selected, which is the lesser cost. */}
        <div className="absolute inset-0 -z-10 overflow-hidden">
          {/* Resolution, as on the auth pages: w=1920 with no `sizes` meant
              Next defaulted to 100vw and, with deviceSizes then capped at
              1200, every Retina screen upscaled a 1200px file to fill the
              hero. Unlike the sign-in backdrop this master is only 2448x2448,
              so 2448x1377 is the whole 16:9 centre crop there is. Asking
              Unsplash for 3840 would just have it enlarge the same detail
              into a file twice the size, so the request stops at native and
              Next's own resize (`withoutEnlargement`) holds the ceiling.

              `sizes` accounts for object-cover overdraw: the section is
              min-h-screen and grows with the longer tabs, so on a portrait
              viewport the height binds and the image paints roughly four
              times the viewport width. Browsers pick from the width alone,
              so the plain 100vw default asked for a quarter of what it drew.
              Same reasoning, and the same numbers, as (pages)/login/page.tsx. */}
