                  <p>Wallplace operates a formal three-strike policy to address repeat infringement:</p>

                    <li><strong className="text-foreground">Strike 1:</strong> formal written warning, content removed, upload-time warranty reconfirmation required, and a note placed on the account.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-foreground">Strike 2:</strong> temporary account suspension of at least 30 days, review of all listings, and removal of any other listings that cannot be independently verified.</li>
                    <li><strong className="text-foreground">Strike 3:</strong> permanent account termination. Outstanding payouts may be withheld pending resolution of any outstanding claims. The account holder will be banned from re-registering on the Platform.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Wallplace may, at its discretion, skip to an earlier or later strike depending on the severity of the infringement, evidence of wilful conduct, or the presence of any court order or ruling.</p>

                  Submitting a knowingly false takedown notice may give rise to liability under the Defamation Act 2013, the tort of malicious falsehood, or similar laws. Repeat false notices will be disregarded, and we may pursue the sender for any loss caused to Wallplace or to the affected user.
