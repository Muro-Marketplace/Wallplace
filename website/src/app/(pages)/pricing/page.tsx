  {
    question: "What is a platform fee?",
    answer:
      "The platform fee is the percentage Wallplace takes when a sale is made through the platform – whether that's a venue purchasing work outright, or a customer buying directly from a venue display. It is separate from your membership cost. Core artists pay 15%, Premium 8%, and Pro artists pay 5% — so our fees run 5–15% depending on plan. You keep the rest.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the first month really free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every approved artist gets their first month at no cost, on any tier. You can start with Core and upgrade later, or begin on Premium or Pro – the first month is always free. After that, billing begins on your chosen plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my tier?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. If you upgrade mid-cycle, the difference is prorated. Downgrading takes effect at the start of your next billing period.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is placement guaranteed?",
    answer:
      "No. We are a platform that connects artists with venues – we do not guarantee placement in any specific venue. What we do is ensure your profile is in front of venues that are actively looking for artwork, and we work to match you with the right spaces for your practice.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when I cancel?",
    answer:
      "You can cancel at any time. Your membership remains active until the end of the period you have paid for. We will arrange the return of any artwork currently on display with venues, and your profile will be removed from the platform. No cancellation fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any other fees?",
    answer:
      "No hidden fees. Your monthly membership and the platform fee on sales are the only costs. Delivery, framing, and any materials are your own costs as an artist – Wallplace does not add charges for these.",
  },
