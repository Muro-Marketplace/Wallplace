// Review finding: these three images used to carry invented location
// captions ("Office reception, Manchester" and so on), and the same
// Unsplash photo IDs are captioned as different invented places on
// /curated and /venues. A sceptical buyer evaluating a 12-month
// commitment notices that, and it undermines the section's actual
// point, that the network is real. The images now run as unattributed
// atmosphere with no caption; the real, checkable proof is the link
// into /browse below, where every artist has a genuine portfolio.
//
// Nav-broadening plan: swapped the Unsplash stand-ins for Wallplace's
// own commissioned photography (an installation in progress, a QR
// scan, a working studio). Still no caption, same reasoning as above;
// alt text describes each scene honestly instead.
//
// venues-qr-scan.webp was queried on 10 September 2026 and kept, at the
// owner's direction. Recording the query rather than the conclusion, because
// the owner knows where the batch came from and this file does not:
//
//   - the micro-text on the wall card does not resolve at any zoom
//   - the QR on the card is a different pattern from the one on the screen
//   - the camera view does not line up with where the card sits on the wall
//
// Worth a second look only if the batch's provenance ever comes into question,
// since src/app/page.tsx:187 carries a "No AI art" badge and
// artist-agreement/page.tsx:74 makes every artist warrant the same of their
// own work. Not a code concern, and not a reason to touch this array again.

                  Most art-for-business suppliers are rental agencies. They license stock prints
                  or rotate a pool of anonymous work, take a monthly fee, and nobody local sees a
                  penny of it.

                  Wallplace Programmes works differently. Every piece is an original, made by a
                  named local artist, and that artist is paid rent for as long as it&rsquo;s on
                  your wall, not a one-off fee. If a member of staff or a guest wants to buy
                  what&rsquo;s on display, they scan the QR card and the artist gets paid again.
