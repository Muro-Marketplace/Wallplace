                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Wallplace connects artists with commercial venues such as cafes, restaurants, hotels, offices, and bars. The Platform enables artists to showcase their work and enables venues to discover and source original artwork.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace is not a party to any sale. The contract of sale is directly between the artist and the buyer. Wallplace facilitates the connection and provides payment infrastructure, but does not manufacture, store, inspect, or ship artwork.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace does not hold buyer funds. Payments are processed and distributed via Stripe Connect, a third-party payment service.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace curates artist applications but does not guarantee placement in any venue. Wallplace is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or suitability of any artwork listed on the Platform.</p>
                </div>

                  <p>One account per person or entity. Wallplace may refuse or revoke accounts at its discretion.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Artists must be accepted through the application process, which is at the sole discretion of Wallplace. Acceptance is based on quality, originality, consistency, and commercial suitability.</p>
                  <p>Accepted artists must select a membership plan with associated monthly fees and platform fees on sales, as detailed on the <Link href="/pricing" className="text-accent hover:underline">Pricing</Link> page.</p>
                  <p>Artists must maintain accurate portfolio listings with genuine photographs of their own work. Artists grant Wallplace a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to display and use artwork images for Platform operation and marketing. Full copyright and ownership is retained by the artist at all times.</p>
                  <p>Artists are responsible for fulfilment of all orders, including packing, shipping, and delivery.</p>
                  <p>Full artist obligations are set out in the <Link href="/artist-agreement" className="text-accent hover:underline">Artist Agreement</Link>.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Venues may register and use the Platform at no cost. There are no registration fees, membership fees, commissions, or hidden charges while you maintain an active account.</p>
                  <p>Venues must exercise reasonable care over displayed artwork, to the same standard as their own property of equivalent value. Venues are liable for damage caused by the negligence of venue staff, contractors, or agents.</p>
                  <p>Venues must hold appropriate public liability insurance. QR labels must remain clearly visible and unobstructed on all displayed artwork.</p>
                  <p>Full venue obligations are set out in the <Link href="/venue-agreement" className="text-accent hover:underline">Venue Partnership Agreement</Link>.</p>

              <div>
                <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">7. Buyer Terms</h2>
                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Buyers may purchase artwork by scanning QR labels on displayed artwork or by browsing the Platform directly. The contract of sale is between the buyer and the artist. Wallplace is not the seller.</p>
                  <p>Prices are displayed in GBP. Payment is processed via Stripe. Wallplace does not hold buyer funds at any point.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Cooling-off period:</strong> Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period for online purchases, except for bespoke or personalised artwork (which is commissioned specifically for you and is exempt under Regulation 28(1)(b)). To cancel, notify the artist within 14 days of receiving the artwork. Return the artwork in its original condition at your own cost (unless faulty). The artist will issue a refund within 14 days of receiving the returned artwork.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Faulty or misdescribed goods:</strong> You have additional rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, including the right to repair, replacement, or refund for goods that are faulty or not as described.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Seller information:</strong> The seller for each order is the individual artist, not Wallplace. The artist&rsquo;s trading name and contact route are disclosed on every listing page and in your order confirmation, as required under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Delivery responsibility:</strong> Risk of loss or damage in transit remains with the seller (the artist) until the artwork is received by the buyer at the delivery address. Wallplace is not a party to the delivery contract and is not liable for delays, loss, or damage caused by third-party couriers. Artists are expected to use a reputable, tracked courier service appropriate to the value of the work.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Signature on delivery:</strong> Artworks sold for <strong className="text-foreground">&pound;500 or more</strong> require a signed-for delivery service. Artists are responsible for arranging this and must retain proof of signature for at least 12 months.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Item not received:</strong> If an order has not arrived by the expected delivery window, the buyer may raise an &ldquo;Item not received&rdquo; dispute through the account dashboard. The dispute flow asks the buyer to confirm they have checked with neighbours and the delivery address, and to report any delivery notification or tracking status. Wallplace will then contact the artist and the courier to investigate. Where tracking shows the item was not delivered or a signature (where required) is missing, Wallplace will typically refund the buyer and recover the amount from the artist&rsquo;s future payouts. See <Link href="/complaints" className="text-accent hover:underline">Complaints Procedure</Link> for escalation routes.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">If an artist becomes unresponsive:</strong> Where an artist fails to respond to a legitimate refund or return request within 7 days, Wallplace may, at its discretion, issue a refund to you on the artist&rsquo;s behalf and recover that amount from future payouts owed to the artist. This is a goodwill measure and does not make Wallplace a party to the contract of sale.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>All payments are processed through Stripe and Stripe Connect. Wallplace does not hold, process, or have access to buyer payment details.</p>
                  <p>Artist membership fees are billed monthly via Stripe. Platform fees are deducted automatically at the point of each transaction via Stripe Connect.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace is not responsible for payment failures, delays, or errors caused by Stripe or any payment provider.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Artists retain full copyright and ownership of their work at all times. By listing artwork on the Platform, artists grant Wallplace a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, display, and reproduce artwork images for Platform operation and marketing. This licence continues while the artwork is listed, plus a 90-day wind-down period after removal.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Prohibited content:</strong></p>

              <div>
                <h2 className="text-2xl mb-4">10A. Non-Circumvention</h2>
                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>The Platform&rsquo;s value depends on transactions occurring through it. To protect that value, the following non-circumvention obligation applies to artists and venues.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Introduction Period:</strong> For 24 months from the date an artist and a venue first communicate through the Platform (the &ldquo;Introduction Period&rdquo;), any sale, commission, loan, display arrangement, or revenue-share arrangement between that artist and that venue (or any group company, connected person, successor, or affiliate of either) must be transacted and recorded through the Platform.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Prohibited conduct during the Introduction Period includes:</strong></p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                    <li>Arranging off-platform sales, commissions, or loans to avoid Platform fees</li>
                    <li>Soliciting another user&rsquo;s contact details for the purpose of transacting off-platform</li>
                    <li>Encouraging a buyer to cancel an on-platform order and re-purchase privately</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Liquidated damages:</strong> The parties agree that quantifying loss from circumvention is difficult. As a genuine pre-estimate of Wallplace&rsquo;s loss, breach of this clause entitles Wallplace to recover from the breaching party liquidated damages equal to the platform fee Wallplace would have earned on the circumvented transaction at the breaching party&rsquo;s applicable fee rate, subject to a minimum of &pound;150 per circumvented transaction. This amount represents a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and is not a penalty. Wallplace may set this amount off against future payouts or invoice for it directly.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">What is permitted:</strong> Post-Introduction-Period dealings are unrestricted. Artists and venues who discover each other independently of the Platform (e.g. through pre-existing relationships, unrelated introductions, or public directories) are not bound by this clause in respect of that independent relationship, provided they can demonstrate independence on request.</p>

You may not assign your rights under these terms without consent. Wallplace may assign its rights freely. No third party has rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>
