                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Wallplace connects artists with commercial venues such as cafes, restaurants, hotels, offices, and bars. The Platform enables artists to showcase their work and enables venues to discover and source original artwork.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace is not a party to any sale. The contract of sale is directly between the artist and the buyer. Wallplace facilitates the connection and provides payment infrastructure, but does not manufacture, store, inspect, or ship artwork.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace does not hold buyer funds. Payments are processed and distributed via Stripe Connect, a third-party payment service.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace curates artist applications but does not guarantee placement in any venue. Wallplace is not responsible for the quality, safety, legality, or suitability of any artwork listed on the Platform.</p>

                  <p>You must be at least 18 years old to create an account, and you confirm that when you sign up. If we find an account belongs to someone under 18 we close it and delete the data held under it. You must provide accurate, complete, and current information during registration and keep it updated.</p>
                  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity that occurs under it. You must notify Wallplace immediately if you suspect unauthorised access.</p>

                  <p>Artists must be accepted through the application process, which is at the sole discretion of Wallplace. Acceptance is based on quality, originality, consistency, and commercial suitability.</p>
                  <p>Accepted artists must select a membership plan with associated monthly fees and platform fees on sales, as detailed on the <Link href="/pricing" className="text-accent hover:underline">Pricing</Link> page.</p>
                  <p>Artists must maintain accurate portfolio listings with genuine photographs of their own work. Artists grant Wallplace a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to display and use artwork images for Platform operation and marketing. Full copyright and ownership is retained by the artist at all times.</p>
                  <p>Artists are responsible for fulfilment of all orders, including packing, shipping, and delivery.</p>

                  <p>Venues may register and use the Platform at no cost. There are no registration fees, membership fees, commissions, or hidden charges while you maintain an active account.</p>
                  <p>Venues must exercise reasonable care over displayed artwork, to the same standard as their own property of equivalent value. Venues are liable for damage caused by the negligence of venue staff, contractors, or agents.</p>
                  <p>Venues must hold appropriate public liability insurance. QR labels must remain clearly visible and unobstructed on all displayed artwork.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Buyers may purchase artwork by scanning QR labels on displayed artwork or by browsing the Platform directly. The contract of sale is between the buyer and the artist. Wallplace is not the seller.</p>
                  <p>Prices are displayed in GBP. Payment is processed via Stripe. Wallplace does not hold buyer funds at any point.</p>
                  <p id="cooling-off" className="scroll-mt-24"><strong className="text-foreground">Cooling-off period:</strong> Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, you have a 14-day cooling-off period for online purchases, except for bespoke or personalised artwork (which is commissioned specifically for you and is exempt under Regulation 28(1)(b)). To cancel, notify the artist within 14 days of receiving the artwork. Return the artwork in its original condition at your own cost (unless faulty). The artist will issue a refund within 14 days of receiving the returned artwork.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Faulty or misdescribed goods:</strong> You have additional rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, including the right to repair, replacement, or refund for goods that are faulty or not as described.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Seller information:</strong> The seller for each order is the individual artist, not Wallplace. The artist&rsquo;s trading name and contact route are disclosed on every listing page and in your order confirmation, as required under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Delivery responsibility:</strong> Risk of loss or damage in transit remains with the seller (the artist) until the artwork is received by the buyer at the delivery address. Wallplace is not a party to the delivery contract and is not liable for delays, loss, or damage caused by third-party couriers. Artists are expected to use a reputable, tracked courier service appropriate to the value of the work.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Signature on delivery:</strong> Artworks sold for <strong className="text-foreground">&pound;100 or more</strong> require a signed-for delivery service. Artists are responsible for arranging this and must retain proof of signature for at least 12 months.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Item not received:</strong> If an order has not arrived by the expected delivery window, the buyer may raise an &ldquo;Item not received&rdquo; dispute through the account dashboard. The dispute flow asks the buyer to confirm they have checked with neighbours and the delivery address, and to report any delivery notification or tracking status. Wallplace will then contact the artist and the courier to investigate. Where tracking shows the item was not delivered or a signature (where required) is missing, Wallplace will typically refund the buyer and recover the amount from the artist&rsquo;s future payouts. See <Link href="/complaints" className="text-accent hover:underline">Complaints Procedure</Link> for escalation routes.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">If an artist becomes unresponsive:</strong> Where an artist fails to respond to a legitimate refund or return request within 7 days, Wallplace may, at its discretion, issue a refund to you on the artist&rsquo;s behalf and recover that amount from future payouts owed to the artist. This is a goodwill measure and does not make Wallplace a party to the contract of sale.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>Wallplace lets users upload artwork, write profiles and blog posts, and message one another privately. That makes us responsible for protecting people who use the Platform from illegal content, and this section says how we do it.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">What is not allowed.</strong> Content that is a criminal offence to share is prohibited outright. That includes child sexual abuse material, terrorist content, threats to kill or cause serious harm, content inciting hatred or violence against a group, intimate images shared without the subject&rsquo;s consent, content encouraging serious self-harm or suicide, fraud, and the sale of goods it is unlawful to sell.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">How to tell us.</strong> Every artwork, artist profile, venue profile and collection carries a Report link, and every conversation carries a Report option. The categories include the kinds of illegal content above. If you do not have an account, or the content is about you rather than posted to you, email <a href="mailto:report@wallplace.co.uk" className="text-accent hover:underline">report@wallplace.co.uk</a>. You do not need to be a Wallplace user to report something to us.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">What we do.</strong> Reports in an illegal-content category are looked at ahead of the queue and acknowledged the same working day. Where content is clearly or credibly illegal we remove or restrict access to it as soon as we have looked at it and investigate afterwards. Depending on what we find we warn, suspend or permanently close the account, and we escalate to the relevant authority where we must. We keep a record of every report, what we decided, and why.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">If you think we got it wrong.</strong> If we remove your content or restrict your account you can appeal, and a different person reviews it wherever possible. If we were wrong we put it back and say so. See <Link href="/acceptable-use" className="text-accent hover:underline">Acceptable Use</Link> and our <Link href="/complaints" className="text-accent hover:underline">Complaints Policy</Link>.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Enforcement.</strong> We apply these standards consistently, to every account, whatever an artist pays us. Nothing about a paid plan buys leniency here.</p>

                  <p>If someone is in immediate danger, contact the police on 999. Tell us as well, but tell them first.</p>

                <div className="space-y-3 text-muted leading-relaxed">
                  <p>The Platform&rsquo;s value depends on transactions occurring through it. To protect that value, the following non-circumvention obligation applies to artists and venues.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Introduction Period:</strong> For 24 months from the date an artist and a venue first communicate through the Platform (the &ldquo;Introduction Period&rdquo;), any sale, commission, loan, display arrangement, or revenue-share arrangement between that artist and that venue (or any group company, connected person, successor, or affiliate of either) must be transacted and recorded through the Platform.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Prohibited conduct during the Introduction Period includes:</strong></p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                    <li>Arranging off-platform sales, commissions, or loans to avoid Platform fees</li>
                    <li>Soliciting another user&rsquo;s contact details for the purpose of transacting off-platform</li>
                    <li>Encouraging a buyer to cancel an on-platform order and re-purchase privately</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Who this clause applies to:</strong> the liquidated damages below apply only where you are acting for purposes relating to your trade, business, craft or profession. If you are a consumer, they do not apply to you at all: we may still ask you to put the transaction through the Platform, and we may suspend or close your account for repeated circumvention, but we will not charge you a fixed sum.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">Liquidated damages (business users only):</strong> The parties agree that quantifying loss from circumvention is difficult. As a genuine pre-estimate of Wallplace&rsquo;s loss, breach of this clause entitles Wallplace to recover from the breaching party liquidated damages equal to the platform fee Wallplace would have earned on the circumvented transaction at the breaching party&rsquo;s applicable fee rate, subject to a minimum of &pound;150 per circumvented transaction. This amount represents a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and is not a penalty. Wallplace may set this amount off against future payouts, having first told you the amount and why, or invoice for it directly.</p>
                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">What is permitted:</strong> Post-Introduction-Period dealings are unrestricted. Artists and venues who discover each other independently of the Platform (e.g. through pre-existing relationships, unrelated introductions, or public directories) are not bound by this clause in respect of that independent relationship, provided they can demonstrate independence on request.</p>

                  <p>The Platform is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo;. Wallplace excludes all warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>
                  <p>Wallplace is not liable for:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                    <li>Loss of profits, business, data, or goodwill</li>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">For consumers:</strong> we do not limit our liability to you for loss that we cause and that was a foreseeable result of our breaking these terms or failing to use reasonable care and skill. We are not liable for loss that was not foreseeable, or for loss arising from an act or omission of the artist, the venue or the courier, none of whom is our agent. Nothing in this section reduces or limits your non-excludable statutory rights, including your rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in these terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of terms implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or sections 9 to 11 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p>

                  <p><strong className="text-foreground">If you are a consumer:</strong> you are not asked to indemnify Wallplace. You remain responsible under the general law for loss you cause by breaking these terms, and nothing here adds to that.</p>

                  <p>Either party may terminate with 30 days&rsquo; written notice. Wallplace may suspend or terminate accounts immediately for breach, prohibited conduct, or where continued access poses a risk.</p>
                  <p>On termination: artists must arrange collection of artwork from venues within 30 days; outstanding payments will be processed; and no further charges will be made.</p>
                  <p>Membership refunds on termination. If you close your account, the paid period runs to its end and is not refunded. If <strong className="text-foreground">we</strong> close or suspend your account for a reason other than your breach of these terms, or if you leave because you objected to a change under section 15, we refund the unused part of the period you have paid for.</p>

                  <p>Wallplace may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified by email or Platform notice at least 14 days before taking effect, and the notice will say what is changing.</p>
                  <p>If you do not want to accept a material change, you may close your account at any point before it takes effect, or within 30 days after, and we will refund the unused part of any membership you have already paid for. That is true whatever section 14 says about refunds on termination.</p>
                  <p>If you keep using the Platform after a change takes effect and have not told us you object, the updated terms apply to you.</p>

                <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">These terms, together with the Artist Agreement, Venue Partnership Agreement, Acceptable Use and Content Standards, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Wallplace. If any provision is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions continue in full force. A failure to enforce any right is not a waiver of that right. You may not assign your rights under these terms without consent. Wallplace may assign its rights freely. No third party has rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>
