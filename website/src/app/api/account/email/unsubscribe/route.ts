// One-click unsubscribe endpoint backing the List-Unsubscribe-Post header
// + the unsubscribe link in every preferences-bearing email. RFC 8058
// requires the POST variant to work without confirmation, the page-side
// GET wrapper just renders a friendly "you've been unsubscribed" screen.
//
// Auth model: anonymous, but only mutates the row matching the userId in
// the URL. The link itself acts as the bearer, so we accept it even
// without a session. Anyone who has the URL has read the inbox it was
// delivered to, which is the same trust boundary Gmail's one-click flow
// uses. We never reveal whether the userId / category combination
// existed; success message is identical either way.
//
// C27. Being anonymous, the endpoint used to hand whatever arrived in `u`
// straight to an upsert. email_preferences.user_id is a bare
// `uuid PRIMARY KEY` in migration 016 with no REFERENCES auth.users, so
// every call minted a permanent orphan row for any UUID a stranger felt
// like typing, and nothing rate limited the endpoint, so the row count was
// unbounded. Three guards now stand in front of the write:
//
//   1. `u` must parse as a UUID at all (cheap, no I/O).
//   2. the account must actually exist (an application-level FK check,
//      because adding the real constraint needs a migration).
//   3. both verbs are rate limited by IP.
//
// The response is byte-identical whether or not the account exists, so
// this stays useless as an account-existence oracle.

  // the wrong picture of the fallback. The unsigned branch does not reject:
  // it answers 200 and points at /account/email/unsubscribe, which is a public
  // page (no auth gate, verified logged out against production on 10 September
  // 2026) carrying a button per category. So the recipient's route to
  // unsubscribing stays open and one click long, which is what PECR asks for.

  // query string was the entire authorisation, a user id is not a secret, and

  // newsletter. Since ORDER_TOKEN_SECRET is currently unset in production,
