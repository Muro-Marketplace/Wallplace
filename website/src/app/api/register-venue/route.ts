// UK compliance audit, 10 September 2026, finding DP-16.

// This route used the ANON client for its insert, which is why the table
// carried an always-true `WITH CHECK (true)` INSERT policy for anon. The
// publishable key ships in the browser bundle, so that policy let anyone write
// rows straight into a table an admin reads, skipping this route's zod
// validation, its rate limit and its notification side effects.
//
// The route runs server side and has the service-role key, so there was never
// a reason for the anon path. Switched to the admin client, which is what
// every other write route here does; migration 143 then drops the policy and
// revokes the grant behind it. Both halves are needed and the order matters:
// dropping the policy while this still used the anon client would have taken
// the form offline.
