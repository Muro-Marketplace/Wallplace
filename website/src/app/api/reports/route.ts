// Reporting content: an artwork, an artist profile, a venue profile, a collection.
//
// Conversations have had a report path since #20 (`POST /api/messages/report`,
// writing `conversation_reports`). Nothing else did. The marketplace's primary
// content is user-uploaded artwork images and the profiles around them, and
// there was no way for anyone to flag any of it.
//
// The table was already there and waiting: migration 060 created `reports` with
// `reported_entity_type` / `reported_entity_id`, a partial index on the pair,
// and a header saying "no code reads/writes these yet, Phase 2 owns the UI".
// This is that writer. No migration is needed.
//
// Two things the route does NOT do, deliberately:
//
//   - It does not trust the body for who owns the reported thing. The owner is
//     resolved from the entity's own table, so a report cannot be filed against
//     an arbitrary user by anyone who can post JSON.
//   - It does not accept an anonymous report. `reports.reporter_user_id` is
//     NOT NULL with an FK to auth.users, so there is nowhere to put one. A
//     signed-out visitor is pointed at the contact form instead. Widening this
//     needs a migration and a different abuse story, so it is a decision, not
//     an oversight.
