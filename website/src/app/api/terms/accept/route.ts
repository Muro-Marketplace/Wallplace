// E46b (06 B1). This route records acceptance of the platform terms, so its rows
// are the evidence trail for a contractual act.
//
// It used to insert `user_email` straight from the request body while discarding
// the auth error, so an unauthenticated caller could forge a row asserting that
// any email address had accepted, stamped with the attacker's IP. Two harms: a
// forged acceptance against a third party, and repudiation cover for a real one
// ("that row could have been anyone").
//
// Two of the three problems are closed here:
//
//   1. An AUTHENTICATED acceptance now takes the email from the token and
//      ignores the body's. The body can no longer name a third party.
//   2. The body is schema-validated and the route is rate limited. It was four
//      uncapped free-text fields on an unbounded unauthenticated insert.
//
// The third is NOT closed, and cannot be closed here: see the block above the
// unauthenticated branch below. It needs an owner decision, recorded in
// PROGRESS.md.

    // All six callers (three signup pages, ApplicationForm x2) fire immediately

    // session yet. Requiring auth would break every one of them.

    // 06 §3.2 suggests splitting the route and binding pre-signup acceptance to
    // "a short-lived signed token issued by the signup flow". That cannot work:
    // any endpoint that issues such a token pre-auth is itself unauthenticated,
    // so an attacker mints one for a victim's address and is exactly where they
    // started. A pre-auth assertion about an email address is forgeable by
    // construction.
    //
    // The sound fix is to record acceptance AFTER confirmation, from the token,
    // carrying the version through signUp's options.data. That changes when the
    // evidence is stamped, which is a legal-trail decision, not a code one.
