/**
 * Slim chip surfaced on a paid-loan placement card whenever the
 * monthly Stripe subscription isn't active yet. Two intensities:
 *
 * - "Set up payment" (muted) — placement is accepted but billing
 *   hasn't been wired yet. Action chip for venues from the moment
 *   the placement is active so they can find the payment flow.
 *   Artist sees an info-only "Awaiting venue's payment setup" chip.
 *
 * - "Payment past due" (amber, urgent) — used to be the only
 *   variant; now reserved for billing failures (past_due, unpaid).
 *
 * - "Live without payment" (amber) — the work is on the wall AND
 *   billing still isn't set up. The artist is currently going
 *   unpaid for an installed piece — the most urgent state.
 *
 * Visibility:
 *   Renders when ALL of:
 *     - arrangement is paid loan (free_loan with a positive monthly fee)
 *     - subscriptionStatus is missing or not "active" / "trialing"
 *   (Used to also gate on liveFrom — that gate moved into the visual
 *    intensity instead, so venues can find the CTA pre-install too.)
