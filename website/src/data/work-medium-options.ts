/**
 * Common medium / material values for the artwork form. The list is
 * surfaced in the artist profile editor and the portfolio "Edit work"
 * form, both via the searchable Combobox component.
 *
 * It's a guidance list, not an enum — the Combobox runs in
 * `allowCustom` mode so artists can type free-form values like
 * "Oil + gold leaf on linen" when their work doesn't slot neatly
 * into one of the canonical entries.
 *
 * Lives in /src/data so client pages can import it without pulling
 * in another page module (Next.js page files shouldn't be cross-
 * imported — doing so can drag the whole route's runtime into the
 * importer and break rendering).
