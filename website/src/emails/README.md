# Wallplace email templates

A React Email template library with 113 templates, a central registry, a
live preview route, and a unified send pipeline (`@/lib/email/send`).

## Quick start

```bash
# Dev: browse all templates
open http://localhost:3000/email-preview

# Filter by stream / persona / category + search by id
# Click any template to see rendered HTML, subject, preview text,
# plain-text fallback, and the exact mock props used.
```

## The template contract

Every template file exports three things and **default-exports a registry entry**:

```tsx
// src/emails/templates/account/AccountEmailVerification.tsx
export interface AccountEmailVerificationProps { … }

export function AccountEmailVerification(props: Props) {
  return <EmailShell stream="tx" persona="multi" preview="…">…</EmailShell>;
}

export const mock: AccountEmailVerificationProps = { … };

const entry: TemplateEntry<AccountEmailVerificationProps> = {
  id: "account_email_verification",
  stream: "tx", persona: "multi", category: "security",
  subject: "Confirm your Wallplace account",
  previewText: "Tap the button to finish signing up.",
  component: AccountEmailVerification,
  mock,
  canUnsubscribe: false,
  hasInAppEquivalent: false,
  priority: 1, // 1 = MVP, 2 = near-term, 3 = later
};
export default entry;
```

Adding a new template = create the file, push its default into
`EMAIL_REGISTRY` in `registry.ts`. That's it.

## Streams

Three sending streams, each ideally mapped to its own subdomain so
reputation stays isolated. All three can point at the same verified
domain during MVP, move to separate domains as volume grows.

| Stream | Purpose | Examples | Footer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tx` | Transactional critical | Email verify, password reset, order receipt, payouts, contracts, legal | Support + legal links only. No unsubscribe. |
| `notify` | Relational / operational | Placement requests, accept/decline, messages, digests | Preference centre + category unsubscribe |
| `news` | Marketing / editorial | Newsletter, trial ending, re-engagement, promotions | Full unsubscribe + one-click + preference centre |

The footer switches behaviour automatically based on the `stream` prop
on `<EmailShell>`.

## Personas

Same shell, subtle accent + voice differences:

- `artist`, warm orange accent (`#C17C5A`), progress-oriented
- `venue`, muted charcoal accent (`#2F3A4A`), professional
- `customer`, editorial near-black, gallery-catalogue feel
- `multi`, brand orange, both parties
- `system`, grey (rarely used; internal)

## Categories

Drive preference toggles and throttling. Defined in
`src/lib/email/categories.ts`:

```
security, legal, orders_and_payouts    → tx (never throttled, never suppressible)
placements, messages                   → notify (throttled per category)
digests, recommendations               → notify (weekly-ish cap)
tips                                   → news (twice per week cap)
newsletter, promotions                 → news (opt-in only)
```

## Sending a template

Import the component, call `sendEmail()`. The pipeline handles
idempotency, suppression check, preference check, vacation mode,
throttle, render, send, log.

```ts
import { sendEmail } from "@/lib/email/send";
import { AccountEmailVerification } from "@/emails/templates/account/AccountEmailVerification";

await sendEmail({
  idempotencyKey: `verify:${user.id}:${tokenHash}`,
  template: "account_email_verification",
  category: "security",
  to: user.email,
  subject: "Confirm your Wallplace account",
  userId: user.id,
  react: AccountEmailVerification({
    firstName: profile.firstName,
    verificationUrl: `${SITE}/verify?t=${token}`,
    expiresIn: "24 hours",
    supportUrl: `${SITE}/support`,
  }),
});
```

**Always set an `idempotencyKey`.** Webhook retries, double-clicks, and
scheduler retries are all expected, the idempotency key prevents
double-sends.

## MVP wiring (already live)

These are hooked up and will send the moment `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in
production env:

| Template | Triggered at |
|---|---|
| `venue_new_placement_request` | `POST /api/placements` (artist-initiated path) |
| `artist_placement_accepted` | `PATCH /api/placements` on pending → active |
| `artist_placement_declined` | `PATCH /api/placements` on pending → declined (artist was requester) |
| `placement_venue_declined_artist_request` | `PATCH /api/placements` on pending → declined (venue was requester) |
| `artist_application_submitted` | `POST /api/apply` |
| `customer_order_receipt` | Stripe `checkout.session.completed` |
| `artist_work_sold` | Stripe `checkout.session.completed` |
| `artist_payout_sent` | Stripe `payout.paid` |
| `message_unread_notification` | `POST /api/messages` (sends immediately, see TODO below) |

## MVP wiring (still required)

### 1. Email verification + password reset

These come from Supabase Auth, not your API routes. Two options:

**Option A, use Supabase's hosted emails (simplest)**
In Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Email Templates, paste the rendered HTML
from `AccountEmailVerification` and `AccountPasswordReset`. Use
`@react-email/render` in a local script to generate the HTML:

```ts
// scripts/render-auth-emails.ts
import { render } from "@react-email/components";
import { AccountEmailVerification } from "@/emails/templates/account/AccountEmailVerification";
const html = await render(AccountEmailVerification({
  firstName: "{{ .Data.first_name | default: \"there\" }}",
  verificationUrl: "{{ .ConfirmationURL }}",
  expiresIn: "24 hours",
  supportUrl: "https://wallplace.co.uk/support",
}));
console.log(html);
```

Paste the output into Supabase's "Confirm signup" email template.

**Option B, custom SMTP via Resend (full control)**
In Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Auth → SMTP Settings,
configure Resend as the SMTP provider. Still uses Supabase's template
editor but sends via your Resend IP reputation.

**Option C, intercept auth webhooks (most flexibility, most work)**
Supabase emits `user.created` / `password.reset.requested` webhooks. Hook
those up to a route that calls `sendEmail()`. More control, more moving
parts.

### 2. Welcome checklists (per persona)

Fire after email verification. Hook into:

- Supabase auth `user.email_verified` webhook, OR
- The first API call the newly-verified user makes (flag-based: send
  once, set `welcomed_at` on the profile row)

```ts
// pseudo-code, wherever you handle the "user just verified" event
if (!profile.welcomed_at) {
  if (profile.type === "artist") {
    await sendEmail({
      idempotencyKey: `welcome:${user.id}`,
      template: "artist_welcome_checklist",
      category: "recommendations",
      to: user.email,
      subject: `Welcome to Wallplace, ${profile.first_name}`,
      userId: user.id,
      react: ArtistWelcomeChecklist({ … }),
    });
  }
  // + venue / customer variants
  await db.from("profiles").update({ welcomed_at: new Date() }).eq("id", profile.id);
}
```

### 3. Shipping confirmation

Needs an artist "mark shipped" action. When built, call:

```ts
await sendEmail({
  idempotencyKey: `shipped:${orderId}`,
  template: "customer_shipping_confirmation",
  category: "orders_and_payouts",
  to: order.buyerEmail,
  subject: `Your order ${orderId} is on its way`,
  react: CustomerShippingConfirmation({ … }),
});
```

## Delayed / scheduled sends

The pipeline sends immediately by default. Three classes of trigger need
a scheduler:

### Delayed events (10 min "maybe-send" pattern)

Used for: `message_unread_notification` (only send if still unread at
10min), `customer_abandoned_checkout_1h/24h`.

Pick **Inngest** (recommended) or **QStash**. Example with Inngest:

```ts
// 1. On the triggering event:
await inngest.send({
  name: "email/message.maybe-send",
  data: { messageId, recipientUserId },
  delay: "10m",
});

// 2. The Inngest function:
export const maybeSendMessageEmail = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "message-email-maybe" },
  { event: "email/message.maybe-send" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    const stillUnread = await step.run("check-unread", () =>
      isMessageStillUnread(event.data.messageId)
    );
    if (!stillUnread) return;
    await sendEmail({ /* as above */ });
  }
);
```

Today's wiring sends immediately on every message. Swap to the delayed
pattern once Inngest is set up.

### Cron-based (scheduled)

Used for: weekly digests (Tue/Wed 9am), trial ending reminders (3d/1d
out), card expiring (30d out), placement ending soon (14d out).

Use **Vercel Cron**, one file per schedule:

```ts
// src/app/api/cron/weekly-artist-digest/route.ts
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  // Require the cron secret so random callers can't trigger sends.
  if (request.headers.get("authorization") !== `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`) {
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }
  const db = getSupabaseAdmin();
  const { data: artists } = await db.from("artist_profiles").select("…");
  for (const artist of artists || []) {
    const weekStats = await computeStats(artist.user_id);
    if (weekStats.notableEvents < 3) continue; // skip empty weeks
    await sendEmail({
      idempotencyKey: `weekly-digest:${artist.user_id}:${isoWeek(new Date())}`,
      template: "artist_weekly_portfolio_digest",
      category: "digests",
      to: artist.email,
      subject: `Your week on Wallplace`,
      userId: artist.user_id,
      react: ArtistWeeklyPortfolioDigest({ … }),
    });
  }
  return NextResponse.json({ sent: artists?.length ?? 0 });
}
```

In `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/weekly-artist-digest", "schedule": "0 9 * * 2" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/weekly-venue-digest",  "schedule": "0 9 * * 3" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/placement-ending-soon", "schedule": "0 10 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/card-expiring",        "schedule": "0 10 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/trial-ending",         "schedule": "0 10 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/re-engagement",        "schedule": "0 10 * * *" }
  ]
}
```

### State-based (cron + DB query)

Used for: `artist_inactive_14d/30d/90d`, `venue_inactive_*`,
`customer_inactive_*`, `artist_qr_scan_milestone`.

Same pattern as cron, daily job that queries users in the right state
and sends. Remember to include a skip on `last_email_opened_at` to avoid
re-engaging users who are already engaged by email.

## Domain setup in Resend

1. Resend → Domains → Add → `tx.wallplace.co.uk` (region: Dublin)
2. Copy the 3 DNS records Resend shows
3. Paste into your DNS provider (wherever `wallplace.co.uk` lives)
4. Resend → Verify. Usually 5–15 min.
5. Add on the root domain: `_dmarc` TXT with
   `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@wallplace.co.uk; pct=100`
6. Repeat for `notify.wallplace.co.uk` and `news.wallplace.co.uk` as
   volume grows.

Env vars expected by `streams.ts`:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx
EMAIL_FROM_TX=Wallplace <noreply@tx.wallplace.co.uk>
EMAIL_FROM_NOTIFY=Wallplace <notifications@notify.wallplace.co.uk>
EMAIL_FROM_NEWS=Wallplace <hello@news.wallplace.co.uk>
EMAIL_REPLY_TO=hello@wallplace.co.uk
```

Until `notify.` and `news.` are verified, all three can point at `tx.`.

## Compliance checklist

- [x] RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe headers set for non-tx streams
- [x] Physical postal address in every footer
- [x] Preference centre link in every notify/news footer
- [x] Category-scoped unsubscribe URL
- [x] Unsubscribe writes to `email_suppressions`
- [x] Hard bounces auto-added to `email_suppressions`
- [x] `security` / `legal` / `orders_and_payouts` never respect suppressions
- [ ] DMARC `p=reject` (start on `p=none` for 2 weeks → `p=quarantine` → `p=reject`)
- [ ] BIMI (month 3+, needs verified mark certificate)
- [ ] Dedicated IPs on `news.` and `notify.` when volume > 50k/month

## Not yet built

The following are deliberately out of scope, flagging for future
product decisions:

- **In-app calling** (item 16 from original roadmap)
- **Payment authorization hold** (item 22)
- **Internal Slack/PagerDuty alerts**, email is the wrong channel;
  use Slack webhooks instead

Templates deliberately omitted (see the earlier product discussion):

- Editorial variants needing ongoing copy (`_educational`, `_case_study`)
- Internal alerts (belong in Slack/PagerDuty)

## Running the preview

The preview lives at `/email-preview`. It's not gated by auth by
default, add a middleware check or block via `robots.txt` if you want
it hidden in production.

```ts
// Example middleware gate
export function middleware(req: NextRequest) {
  if (req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith("/email-preview")) {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" && !req.cookies.get("admin-token")) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/", req.url));
    }
  }
}
```
