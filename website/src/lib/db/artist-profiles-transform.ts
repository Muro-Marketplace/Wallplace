 * Give every pricing tier a real `label`.
 *
 * QA 2026-08-30 bugs 8, 9 and 10 are one defect: some `artist_works.pricing`
 * rows store the tier name under `size` rather than `label` (19 of 128 tiers
 * live, across 8 works). `SizePricing.label` is typed non-optional, so nothing
 * downstream defends against it, and every consumer read `undefined`:
 *
 *   - the size dropdown rendered three identically blank options (bug 10);
 *   - checkout printed the literal string "undefined" as the size (bug 9);
 *   - the cart keyed all three tiers alike, so picking the 60x90cm (GBP 580)
 *     after the A3 (GBP 180) merged them into two A3s and charged GBP 180
 *     each (bug 8).
 *
 * Normalising at this shared mapper fixes all of them at once, for the portal,
 * the public artist page and the artwork page, rather than patching a dozen
 * `.label` reads one at a time. Neither shape is "wrong" in the data, so this
 * accepts both permanently instead of relying on a one-off backfill.
