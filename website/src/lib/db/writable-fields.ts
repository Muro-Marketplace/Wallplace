//   user_id / slug / artist_id / id          → never client-writable
//   (total_* counters dropped by migration 114; live counts come from analytics)
//   stripe_*                                 → Stripe onboarding + webhooks ONLY
//   lat / lng                                → derived server-side from postcode

 * monthly rent for it. Both drive real money -- accrueProgrammeRent()
 * (src/lib/curation/programme-rent.ts) inserts one accrual row per linked
 * placement on every paid programme invoice -- so a client setting either
 * would let an artist or venue fabricate rent income.
 *
 * Review fix (E23a repeat): this constant used to have ZERO call sites --
 * exactly the shape flagged elsewhere in this codebase (see the E23a comment
 * in api/placements/route.ts): a control that exists, is unit-tested, and
 * protects nothing. It is now enforced by `assertNoServerOwned(payload,
 * PLACEMENT_SERVER_OWNED, "placements")` at every write site in
 * api/placements/route.ts -- the POST insert and both PATCH updates (the
 * counter-terms write and the status/stage write).
 *
 * Still NOT the same shape as the ARTIST_PROFILE_SERVER_OWNED /
 * VENUE_PROFILE_SERVER_OWNED pair above, where ONE upsert function
 * (upsertArtistProfile / upsertVenueProfile) is the single choke point every
 * write funnels through, so ONE assertNoServerOwned() call guards all of
 * them. `placements` has no equivalent choke point -- api/placements/route.ts
 * builds each write payload inline at its own call site rather than through a
 * shared pickWritable()-fed upsert -- so there is no single function to hang
 * one call off. Guarded at each of the three sites instead, which is also why
 * none of them can throw today: `placementUpdateSchema` (lib/validations.ts)
 * has no field for either column and every payload here is built from
 * explicitly named fields, never a body spread, so there is no live path that
 * reaches either column with a client-supplied value. Each call is
 * currently a no-op that passes -- which is the point: defence in depth
 * against the day a future edit adds a body-sourced field to one of these
 * payloads without checking this list first, e.g. an admin route linking a
 * placement to a programme, deliberately left unbuilt by this task.
