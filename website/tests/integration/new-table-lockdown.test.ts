// A new service-role-only table must revoke its client grants in the same
// migration that creates it.
//
// Owner decision 12. Supabase's stock default privileges grant `anon` and
// `authenticated` the full set on every table in `public`, so a `CREATE TABLE`
// that only enables RLS is protected by the ABSENCE of a policy and nothing
// else. Two things that made the width matter:
//
//   TRUNCATE is not subject to RLS. Policies filter SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and
//   DELETE; a table-level TRUNCATE right is not a row operation. So on any such
//   table, RLS was never the last line of defence people assumed.
//
//   One permissive policy added later, for any reason, meets a standing grant
//   that is already there.
//
// Migrations 112 and 113 took those back across the whole schema, and set
// ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES so new tables no longer inherit TRUNCATE, REFERENCES
// or TRIGGER. What a default privilege cannot cover is SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/
// DELETE on a table that is meant to be service-role-only, which is what this
// checks.
