// live schema, because a select naming a column that does not exist is rejected
// whole by PostgREST and the `?? null` fallback yields a plausible-but-wrong
// value. Writes fail exactly the same way and were never scanned, and two live

//
//   artist_applications.referred_by_code   destroyed the referral code on EVERY
//                                          application ever submitted, because a

//                                          recorded. (migration 109)
//   messages.flagged / flagged_reason      dropped message_type, metadata and
//                                          attachments from any message the
//                                          moderation filter flagged, so a
//                                          flagged placement request was stored
//                                          as plain text with none of its terms.
//                                          (09 item 2.2)
//
// Both were found by hand. This finds the next one.
//
// TWO VARIANTS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT COVERED, and both were swept by hand on
// 2026-08-28 and found clean:
//
//   .rpc("fn", {...})            a function that does not exist, or an argument
//                                name that does not match. All four call sites
//                                (claim_artist_work_slot, decrement_work_stock,
//                                increment_placement_revenue, restock_work)
//                                match production exactly.
//   .upsert(..., { onConflict }) a conflict target with no matching unique
//                                constraint, which errors at runtime. All eight
//                                distinct targets have one.
//
// Covering them needs the snapshot to carry functions and unique constraints,
// which means changing its format, its generator and its round-trip test. The
// three variants above found fifteen live defects between them; these two found
// none. Recorded rather than built, so the gap is a decision and not an
// oversight.
